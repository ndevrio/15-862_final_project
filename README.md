# Instructions for running final project

1. Navigate to the directory `calib_data` and run the file `calibrate.py` in the `src` folder with the following flags: `../src/calibrate.py 1080 1920 6 9 24 1`
2. Run the file `main.py` using an Anaconda3 distribution to generate point cloud results
2. Different target objects can be selected by changing the paths at the bottom of the file. In addition some display plots are commented out in certain sections to speed up run times. Uncomment them in the "display" areas to view the plots.
